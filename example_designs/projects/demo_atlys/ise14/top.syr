INFO:Xst:741 - HDL ADVISOR - A 38-bit shift register was found for signal <ipbus/udp_if/IPADDR/IP_addr_rx_block.pkt_mask_41> and currently occupies 38 logic cells (19 slices). Removing the set/reset logic would take advantage of SRL32 (and derived) primitives and reduce this to 1 logic cells (1 slices). Evaluate if the set/reset can be removed for this simple shift register. The majority of simple pipeline structures do not need to be set/reset operationally.
